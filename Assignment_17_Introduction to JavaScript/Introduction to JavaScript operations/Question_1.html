    <h2>Explain the role of operators in JavaScript. Why are they essential in programming?</h2>
    <p>Operators in JavaScript are symbols that perform operations on operands, such as variables, values, or expressions. They are essential in programming because they allow developers to perform various tasks, such as arithmetic operations, comparisons, logical operations, assignment, and more. Here are some key roles and types of operators in JavaScript:</p>
    <ol>
        <li><b>Arithmetic Operators:</b>These operators perform arithmetic operations like addition (+), subtraction (-), multiplication (*), division (/), and modulus (%). They are fundamental for mathematical calculations in programming.</li>
        <li><b>Comparison Operators:</b>Comparison operators are used to compare two values and return a boolean result (true or false). Examples include equal to (==), not equal to (!=), greater than (>), less than (<), etc. They are essential for making decisions and controlling the flow of the program.</li>
        <li><b>Logical Operators:</b>Logical operators are used to combine or modify boolean values. They include AND (&&), OR (||), and NOT (!). Logical operators are crucial for implementing conditional statements and creating complex logical expressions.</li>
        <li><b>Assignment Operators:</b>Assignment operators are used to assign values to variables. The most basic assignment operator is the equal sign (=), but JavaScript also supports compound assignment operators like +=, -=, *=, /=, etc. They are essential for storing and updating data within a program.</li>
        <li><b>Unary Operators:</b>Unary operators work with a single operand. Examples include the unary plus (+) and unary minus (-). They are often used to convert a non-number value to a number or change the sign of a number.</li>
        <li><b>Bitwise Operators:</b>Bitwise operators perform operations on binary representations of numbers. They include bitwise AND (&), bitwise OR (|), bitwise XOR (^), bitwise left shift (<<), bitwise right shift (>>), and bitwise NOT (~). They are mainly used in low-level programming or when dealing with binary data.</li>
        <li><b>Conditional (Ternary) Operator:</b>This is a unique operator in JavaScript that takes three operands and evaluates a condition. It is often used as a shorthand for if-else statements.</li>
