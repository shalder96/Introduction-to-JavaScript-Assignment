        In JavaScript, operators have precedence and associativity, which determine the order in 
        which they are evaluated when multiple operators are used in an expression. Understanding
         these concepts is crucial for writing accurate and predictable code.</p>
    <ol>
        <li>Precedence:
            <ul>
                <li>Precedence determines the order of evaluation of operators in an expression.</li>
                <li>Operators with higher precedence are evaluated first.</li>
                <li>JavaScript follows a set of rules to determine the precedence of operators, similar to mathematical conventions.</li>
                <li>For example, multiplication (*) has higher precedence than addition (+), so in the expression 2 + 3 * 4, the multiplication will be performed first, resulting in 14.</li>

            </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
            Associativity:
            <ul>
                <li>Associativity determines the order of evaluation when multiple operators of the same precedence appear in an expression.</li>
                <li>Associativity can be left-to-right (left-associative) or right-to-left (right-associative).</li>
                <li>Most operators in JavaScript are left-associative, meaning they are evaluated from left to right.</li>
                <li>For example, in the expression 4 - 2 - 1, the subtraction operators are left-associative, so the expression is evaluated as (4 - 2) - 1, resulting in 1.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
    </ol>

    <h3>Understanding precedence and associativity is important for several reasons:</h3>
    <ul>
        <li><b>Correctness:</b> Knowing the precedence of operators ensures that expressions are evaluated correctly according to the intended logic. Incorrect precedence can lead to unexpected results.</li>
        <li><b>Readability:</b> Following precedence rules can make code more readable by reducing the need for excessive parentheses to explicitly specify evaluation order.</li>
        <li><b>Efficiency:</b> Proper use of precedence can optimize code by minimizing unnecessary computations and improving performance.</li>
        <li><b>Debugging:</b> Understanding precedence and associativity helps in debugging code when unexpected results occur due to incorrect evaluation order.</li>
        <li><b>Avoiding Errors:</b> Misunderstanding precedence and associativity can lead to errors in code logic, which can be difficult to identify and debug without a clear understanding of how operators are evaluated.</li>
    </ul>
